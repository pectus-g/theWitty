Hi!
Thank you for purchasing my assets!

To achieve the same graphics as in the video demo and screenshots you have to be sure that you:

1. Set your project to Deferred Rendering Path and enable HDR:
Edit -> Project Settings -> Quality, uncheck the Use Defaults checkbox to the right of every Tier and choose Deferred in Rendering Path. Check the Use HDR checkboxes.

2. Set your project Color Space to Linear: Edit -> Project Settings -> Player > Color Space: Linear;

3. Switch your camera to HDR mode (Checkbox in the camera component);

4. Use Unity Post Processing Stack from the Package Manager with profiles provided in the DemoScene folder.

If you want to achieve more FPS, you can bake the lighting fully to static lightmaps.
To do this, select Lighting Mode: Subtractive in the Lighting Settings window and press "Generate Lighting" button.
Be sure, that you set not too big Lightmap Resolution in Lightmapping Settings, because this can encrease baking time drastically.
7-10 will be enought for test.

To use these assets with the Universal RP look at the Upgrade to URP text file, located in the Asset/Greenwood Fantasy Village folder.


That's all!
